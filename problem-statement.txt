PARALLEL COMPUTING ASSIGNMENT


Consider a large collection of documents distributed in the secondary
memories (i.e. hard disks) of multiple nodes in a cluster:
a) Design a program that extracts words and their frequency of occurrence
from each document and create a word-document index in each node
ranked on the frequency: i.e. for each word, a list of documents is
associated with it and the list is ordered by decreasing frequency (of
occurrence of that word in the document). Each index is local to a node a
word is associated with only those documents in that node. Stop words i.e.
frequently occurring words (e.g. a, an, the, for, if, to, then, on, etc.) need
not be indexed. Assume that a list of stop words is available. Implement
this program using MPI in C.
b) Design a program to merge all indices into one large word-document index
ranked by decreasing frequency to be stored in node. Implement this
program using MPI in C.
c) Measure the time taken for a) and b) for different numbers and sizes of
documents and independently varying the number of processors used. For
each input (of a given number of documents of certain sizes), plot a curve
of time taken against number of processors used.
